# Contactless-Switch
With increased technological advancements, switches require updating with current times. To avoid 
the risk of contracting COVID-19, it has become important to not touch surfaces of buttons and keys 
that have been frequently used by other people. This calls for a need to innovate the switching 
technology for replacing a hand-operated switch, with an automatic contactless switch. 
So, we have designed a no-touch switch that works entirely on hand gestures. Our smart contactless 
switch includes a sensor that is capable of detecting hand  and translates them into 
commands for controlling lights, fans and various home appliances.
